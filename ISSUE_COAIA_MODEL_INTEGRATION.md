# Issue: COAIA Model Integration for FastChat Arena

**Issue ID**: #FASTCHAT-001  
**Created**: 2025-08-02  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: Ready for Testing  

## Summary
Integrate Creative Oriented Artificial Intelligence Agent (COAIA) fine-tuned models into FastChat arena platform for cross-platform model evaluation and human preference collection.

## Background
FastChat provides the gold-standard arena infrastructure used by LMSYS for LLM evaluation. We're integrating our custom COAIA models (fine-tuned on both OpenAI and Google Vertex AI) to enable systematic evaluation and improvement through human preference battles.

## COAIA Models Integrated

## Integration Details

### Model Types
1. **OpenAI COAIA**: Fine-tuned GPT-4.1-nano with 54 model iterations focused on creative orientation
2. **Gemini COAIA**: Multiple Vertex AI fine-tuned models with progressive training phases
3. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Direct comparison between OpenAI and Google fine-tuning approaches

### FastChat Compatibility
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses existing OpenAI API provider (`api_provider.py`)
- **Vertex AI Integration**: Leverages Vertex AI model support for Gemini models
- **Anonymous Battles**: Models appear as "Model A" vs "Model B" for unbiased evaluation
- **ELO Rating System**: Bradley-Terry model for statistical ranking

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created
- `api_endpoints.json` - COAIA model configuration
- Uses existing FastChat infrastructure without core modifications
- Leverages built-in support for OpenAI and Vertex AI providers

### Deployment Requirements
- FastChat v0.2.36+ with webui and model_worker features
- OpenAI API key for fine-tuned model access
- Google Cloud authentication for Vertex AI models
- Proper GPU/memory resources for inference

### Service Architecture
```bash
# Controller (coordinates models)
python3 -m fastchat.serve.controller --host 0.0.0.0 --port 21001

# Web Server (arena interface)
python3 -m fastchat.serve.gradio_web_server \
  --controller-url http://localhost:21001 \
  --register-api-endpoint-file api_endpoints.json \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7860
```

## User Experience

### Battle Flow
1. **Prompt Entry**: User enters creative orientation challenge
2. **Anonymous Generation**: Two COAIA models generate responses
3. **Side-by-Side Display**: Responses shown as "Model A" vs "Model B"
4. **Human Voting**: User selects better response for structural tension demonstration
5. **Model Reveal**: Shows OpenAI vs Gemini COAIA identity
6. **Data Collection**: Vote recorded for ELO rating and DPO training

### Creative Orientation Evaluation
- **Structural Tension** vs gap-thinking patterns
- **Desired Outcomes** vs problem-solving approaches  
- **Natural Advancement** vs oscillating behaviors
- **Creative Process Phases** vs inspiration/ideation cycles

## Expected Outcomes

### Model Comparison Data
- Direct performance comparison between OpenAI and Vertex AI fine-tuning
- Human preference patterns for creative orientation responses
- ELO rating evolution showing superior approach over time

### Preference Data for DPO
- High-quality human feedback for Direct Preference Optimization
- Structured training data for next model improvement iteration
- Validation of creative orientation principles in practice

## Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Technical Validation
- [ ] Verify all COAIA models load correctly
- [ ] Test anonymous battle generation
- [ ] Confirm voting and ELO update functionality
- [ ] Validate data logging and collection

### Phase 2: Content Validation  
- [ ] Test with creative orientation prompts
- [ ] Verify response quality differences between models
- [ ] Confirm human voters can distinguish better responses
- [ ] Validate preference data quality

### Phase 3: Production Validation
- [ ] Extended uptime testing
- [ ] Multiple concurrent user battles
- [ ] Data collection pipeline verification
- [ ] Performance monitoring under load

## Success Metrics

## Integration Validation

### API Connectivity Tests
```python
# OpenAI COAIA Model Test
import openai
client = openai.OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="ft:gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14:jgwill:coaia250709n1b3:BrWkpMDi",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Test creative orientation response"}]
)

# Vertex AI COAIA Model Test  
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel
vertexai.init(project="top-moment-465521-v9", location="us-central1")
model = GenerativeModel("projects/242650888445/locations/us-central1/models/7008782995188350976")
response = model.generate_content("Test creative orientation response")
```

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Uses proven FastChat infrastructure with minimal modifications
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and deployment validation
- **Rollback**: Simple service restart returns to baseline state

## Dependencies
- FastChat v0.2.36+
